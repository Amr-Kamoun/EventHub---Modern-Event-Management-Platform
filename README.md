## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/amrkamoun/ATC_01099011493.git
   cd eventhub
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> **Note**: For the smoothest experience, it's recommended to use incognito mode when testing the application.

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Supabase credentials:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Set up your Supabase database:
   ```
   Ensure your Supabase project contains the required tables and RLS policies.
   SQL schema/migration files are located in:
   /supabase/migrations/
   ```
   See the [Backend Setup](#backend-setup-supabase) section for detailed instructions.

## 🔐 Demo Accounts

Use the following demo accounts to test the app:

| Role  | Email              | Password  |
|-------|-------------------|-----------|
| Admin | admin@example.com | Admin123! |
| User  | user@example.com  | User123!  |

## Database Schema

- **profiles**: User profiles and roles
- **events**: Event details and metadata
- **registrations**: Event registrations and tickets

## Backend Setup (Supabase)

This project uses Supabase as the backend platform. Follow these instructions to set up the backend:

1. Create a new project on [supabase.com](https://supabase.com/)
2. Create the required tables:
   - `profiles`
   - `events`
   - `registrations`

3. Apply RLS (Row-Level Security) policies:
   - Enable RLS on all tables
   - Create policies to restrict access to authenticated users only

4. Run SQL setup files (optional):
   SQL files are located in:
   `/supabase/migrations/`

### Tables Overview

| Table        | Purpose                              |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| `profiles`   | User info and role (admin/user)       |
| `events`     | Event data (title, date, location…)   |
| `registrations` | Bookings linked to user + event     |

### Environment Variables

For the application to connect to your Supabase backend, you'll need to set up the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) policies protect data access
- Role-based access control for admin features
- Secure authentication via Supabase Auth
